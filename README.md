# MachineLearning
## Introduction

In classical programming, given a problem, you define a specific set of rules to solve the problem.  For example, if you want to identify if a shape is a circle or a square, you would write a program to detect corners and count them. If the program sees 4 corners, the shape is identified as a square.  If the program sees no corners, the shape is identified as a circle.

Machine Learning is learning by examples. In Machine Learning, to identify a shape as a circle or a square, we provide the program many examples of circles and squares.  After the Machine has learnt from the examples given, if the machine is given a new image of a circle or square, one that it has not seen before, it should hopefully identify it correctly.

Machine Learning is accomplished by a set of functions called algorithms.  Algorithm is considered as learning unit of the Machine Learning.  Similarly, neuron is the learning unit of the brain.  So, if neuron is a algorithm, then Neural Networks is a network of algorithms, output of one algorithm acting as input of another algorithm.

## Examples of using Machine Learning

### Text Pattern Recognition

We will use the [website](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/) for this exercise

Let us watch the screen recording - [Text Pattern Recognition](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ak2-o17j_0K2pjdsGA9RKCs7KUq3?e=CUA6b6) to build a scratch program to recommend a club based on our likes.
